SSA2py Documentation (|release|)
================================

SSA2py is an open-source python project that follows the Source-Scanning Algorithm (SSA), a
back-projection implementation by Honn Kao and Shao-Ju Shan (`2004 <https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/157/2/589/633788?login=true>`_, `2007 <https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/168/3/1011/2042108?login=true>`_). It provides interconnection 
with FDSN Compliant Web Services and it is adapted to run in GPU and CPU multiprocessing architectures.
The aim of SSA2py is to provide rapid and accurate calculations of SSA method in near-realtime conditions.
