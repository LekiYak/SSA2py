def circular_hist(ax, x, bins=16, density=True, offset=0, gaps=True):
    """
    Produce a circular histogram of angles on ax.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ax : matplotlib.axes._subplots.PolarAxesSubplot
        axis instance created with subplot_kw=dict(projection='polar').

    x : array
        Angles to plot, expected in units of radians.

    bins : int, optional
        Defines the number of equal-width bins in the range. The default is 16.

    density : bool, optional
        If True plot frequency proportional to area. If False plot frequency
        proportional to radius. The default is True.

    offset : float, optional
        Sets the offset for the location of the 0 direction in units of
        radians. The default is 0.

    gaps : bool, optional
        Whether to allow gaps between bins. When gaps = False the bins are
        forced to partition the entire [-pi, pi] range. The default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    n : array or list of arrays
        The number of values in each bin.

    bins : array
        The edges of the bins.

    patches : `.BarContainer` or list of a single `.Polygon`
        Container of individual artists used to create the histogram
        or list of such containers if there are multiple input datasets.
